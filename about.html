                            and spark powerful conversations. We’re an open platform where over 100 million readers
                            come to find insightful and dynamic thinking. Here, expert and undiscovered voices alike
                            dive into the heart of any topic and bring new ideas to the surface. Our purpose is to
                            spread these ideas and deepen understanding of the world.

                            We’re creating a new model for digital publishing. One that supports nuance, complexity,
                            and vital storytelling without giving in to the incentives of advertising.
                            It’s an environment that’s open to everyone but promotes substance and authenticity.
                            And it’s where deeper connections forged between readers and writers can lead to discovery
                            and growth. Together with millions of collaborators, we’re building a trusted and vibrant
                            ecosystem fueled by important ideas and the people who think about them.
